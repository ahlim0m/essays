## Learning Javascript As A NewBie

As a [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) newbie, the language looked very similar to other programming languages I am familiar with, such as C, C++, and Java. Becoming a professional web developer/desginer is one of the career goals I have in mind. With that being said, I've always wanted to learn Javascript and was very excited to start ICS314. One of the assginments, learning basic Javascript through the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) has taught me the basics of  Javascript in an easy and simple way, and so far I really like the language. The only problem I encountered was syntax differences. For example, I get confused on replacing double equal sign with triple equal sign. I am still more familiar with other languages, but it has been a fun learning experience so far.

I think Javascript is an excellent programming language and I am looking forward to learning Javascript and getting one step closer to my career goal.

## Athletic Software Engineering - the WODs

Taking ICS314, students were introduced with a new method of learning - the WODS(Workout Of the Day). The WOD requires programming accurately and effectively under pressure by giving time limits. This can be stressful especially for people who tend to panic when under pressure. However, it is designed to be similar to the real world experiences which will help students prepare for their job interviews. When doing the first WOD, I felt a little nervous not knowing what it was going to be like. However, when I began coding I noticed I was more focused than I would have been without a time limit. Working under pressure will definitely help me to code efficiently.
